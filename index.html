                <h2>Hi! I'm Grady.</h2>
                <p>I am a Master's student at The George Washington University studying computer science, expecting to complete the degree in May 2023. In May 2022 I received a B.S. in computer science from The George Washington University's Honors Program.<p/>
                <p>My current CS interests reside in the subdomains of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction. Outside of computers I enjoy running and reading.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I am employing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to develop new features for Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) in order to make them easier for users to learn and become comfortable with. These features include autocorrect, predictive text, and a system for recommending relevant commands to users based on their own unique questions. My work is being advised by <a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~kinga/">Dr. Kinga Dobolyi</a>.</p>

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>I have been serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the past 4 semesters. I have worked on the following courses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~jrt/cs1112/">CSCI 1112</a>: Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring '22)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~cs4all/1012/index.html">CSCI 1012</a>: Intro to Programming in Python (Fall + Spring '20, Fall '21)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before this, I served as a Learning Assistant for CSCI 1012 for 2 semesters.</p>
                <p>In Fall 2022, I will be co-teaching an original 1-credit elective with a fellow student, titled <b><i>Internet Sociology</i></b>. The course is a discussion-based seminar on contemporary critiques of Internet software design and architecture, with readings from scholars in the fields of computer science, philosophy, cognitive psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
