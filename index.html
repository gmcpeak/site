                <h2>Hi! I'm Grady.</h2>
                <p>I am a Master's student at The George Washington University studying computer science, expecting to complete the degree in May 2023. In May 2022 I received a B.S. in computer science from The George Washington University's Honors Program.<p/>
                <p>My current CS interests reside in the subdomains of Machine Learning and Computational Social Science. Outside of computers I enjoy running and reading.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I am employing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to develop new features for Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) in order to make them easier for users to learn and become comfortable with. These features include autocorrect, predictive text, and a system for recommending relevant commands to users based on their own unique questions. My work is being advised by <a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~kinga/">Dr. Kinga Dobolyi</a>.</p>

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>I have been serving as a Graduate and (previously) Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the past 4 semesters. I have worked on the following courses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~kinga/CS1111_S23/">CSCI 1111</a>: Intro to Sofware Development (Spring '23)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://cs2113-f22.github.io/">CSCI 2113</a>: Software Engineering (Fall '22)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~jrt/cs1112/">CSCI 1112</a>: Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring '22)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~cs4all/1012/index.html">CSCI 1012</a>: Intro to Programming in Python (Fall + Spring '20, Fall '21)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before this, I served as a Learning Assistant for CSCI 1012 for 2 semesters.</p>
                <p>This semester, I am co-teaching an original 1-credit elective with a fellow student, titled <b><i>Internet Sociology</i></b>. The course is a discussion-based seminar on contemporary critiques of Internet software design and architecture, with readings from scholars in the fields of computer science, philosophy, cognitive psychology, economics, and political science. This course was also run in Fall 2022.</p>
