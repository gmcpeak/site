                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>I have been serving as a Graduate and (previously) Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the past 4 semesters. I have worked on the following courses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~kinga/CS1111_S24/">CSCI 1111</a>: Intro to Sofware Development (Spring '23, Spring '24)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://cs2113-f22.github.io/">CSCI 2113</a>: Software Engineering (Fall '22)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~jrt/cs1112/">CSCI 1112</a>: Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring '22)</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~cs4all/1012/index.html">CSCI 1012</a>: Intro to Programming in Python (Fall + Spring '20, Fall '21)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before this, I served as a Learning Assistant for CSCI 1012 for 2 semesters.</p>
                <p>In Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, I am co-taught an original 1-credit elective with a fellow student, titled <i>Internet Sociology</i>. The course was a discussion-based seminar on contemporary critiques of Internet software design and architecture, with readings from scholars in the fields of computer science, philosophy, cognitive psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
